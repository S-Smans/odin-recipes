    <h2>Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with Sun-Dried Tomato & Basil Beurre Blanc</h2>
    <p>Because everything's better with bacon.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pork tenderloins, trimmed</li>
        <li>2 slices bacon</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup julienned sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained (reserve oil)</li>
        <li>¼ cup white wine</li>
        <li>½ bunch basil, chiffonade</li>
        <li>½ cup cream</li>
        <li>1 stick butter or ¼ pound, cut into 8 small cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. </li>
        <li>Trim all visible fat from tenderloins. Season with salt and pepper and wrap each tenderloin with one piece of bacon; use wooden toothpicks to hold bacon in place.</li>
        <li>Sear in hot pan to brown the bacon, then finish in oven until the internal temperature of the meat is 145°F. Remove from oven and let rest.</li>
        <li>For the sauce, sauté the garlic in 1 tablespoon of the reserved sun-dried tomato oil. Be careful not to brown the garlic as it will make the sauce taste bitter.</li>  
        <li>Deglaze the pan with the white wine and let reduce until all the wine has evaporated. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and basil and sauté for 1 minute. Stir in the cream and reduce by two thirds.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in butter, one small cube at a time until all butter is incorporated. This step must be done off the heat or the sauce will break and appear oily.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, sliced and placed atop a bed of sauce on each plate.</li>
    </ol>
